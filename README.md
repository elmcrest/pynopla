# pynopla
quick and dirty Inopla cloud pbx api thing

#### Why Async?
Well, just because of the fun of it. And to learn asyncio, too.
Another reason might be that it's handy to add arbitrary periodically events - or maybe act on external events from the Inopla api.

#### Scope
This can of course be a start for a fully featured Inpopla.de Client, evolving as needed. So, of course, PRs are very welcomed.
Also I'm happy if you think you can improve things, let me know, I'm open for everything.

#### ToDo
- add tests (mocked)
- add more features
